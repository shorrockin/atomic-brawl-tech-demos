Atomic Brawl - First Tech Demos
===

An embarassing look at some first examples, and tech demos we did for [Atomic Brawl](http://atomicbrawl.com). Used in a blog post over at [blog.atomicbrawl.com](http://blog.atomicbrawl.com).

Note - That this source was mostly quick and dirty tech tests. Also - the code was written using coffeescript, but the generated js files are included in the repo so we could use the checked-in html pages.
